The practice entails solving a robotics challenge where the objective is to navigate a robot to reach a designated target square. 
The robot can move only one square at a time in four directions (North, South, East, West). The map consists of three types of squares:
L (which the robot can pass through), E (which the robot cannot pass through), and T (which represents the target square where the robot finds a screw). 
The starting point is square (1,1). The approach utilized for solving the challenge is backtracking.
